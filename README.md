# Pets-Classifier-more-classes

Built a Pets classifier which takes an image as an input and predicts the breed of dog/cat with 93% accuracy.
Built using the Oxford-IIIT dataset of 37 different pet classes.
Added a few more categories of dogs and cats that can be seen in the subcontinent namely:  'German_Shephard','Golden_Retriever','Labrador','Siberian_Husky','Alaskan_Malamute','American_Bobtale','Cyprus_Cat','Europian_Shorthair','Korat_Cat'
Deployed the model on huggingface spaces using Gradio and Git.
The application can be visited and tested here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/sarmadahmad8/Pets_Classifier
